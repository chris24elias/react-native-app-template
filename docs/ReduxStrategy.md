## Why Easy Peasy over Base Redux

To begin, one of the main issues that gives redux a lot of negative sentiment is the immense boilerplate and configuration that is typical within a Redux Application. Modifiying and creating simple stores in redux is always a tedious task that involves creating/modifying mutiple files and just too much boilerplate. That's where Easy Peasy comes in.
Easy Peasy provides you with an intuitive API to quickly and easily manage the state for your React application. Under the hood Easy Peasy still uses Redux to power the store. Easy Peasy is a full abstraction over Redux, providing an API that is both intuitive and quick to develop against, whilst removing any need for boilerplate. By doing this Easy Peasy gets to leverage Redux's mature architecture while also being able to support the amazing tooling around it. For example it supports Redux Dev Tools Extension out of the box, and has seamless integration with several other packages such as Redux-persist and Redux Logger.

The Library has over 3.5k stars on github and has very good documentation which can be found here :
